## Running from source
WingedGen uses poetry to manage virtual environments. Therefore it is required to install the dependencies and run the game from source without manual tweaking.

### Installing poetry
Follow the instructions for installing poetry from the official website: https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installing-with-the-official-installer

#### Linux, macOS, Windows (WSL)
Open a terminal and paste this:
```
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```

#### Windows (Powershell)
Open a PowerShell window (Windows key and then enter `PowerShell`) and paste this:
```
(Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://install.python-poetry.org -UseBasicParsing).Content | py -
```
or in case you installed Python from the Windows Store:
```
(Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://install.python-poetry.org -UseBasicParsing).Content | python -
```

### Running the game via the helper scripts
#### Linux, macOS
Double click the `run.sh` script or open it in the terminal via `./run.sh` with the current working directory set to the game's root directory

#### Windows
Double click the `run.bat` script

### Bug Reporting
Please report any bugs in the forum post [in the ClanGen Discord, here](https://discord.com/channels/1003759225522110524/1117124733083857068). There is no Discord server for this mod as of right now, may make one by popular demand or if the forum post becomes too full.
Note that not all bugs may be related to this mod. This is running off of dev (as latest of dev as possible as well) so there will be dev bugs in this mod that are completely unrelated to the mod additions.
